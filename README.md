Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis, Preprocessing, Model Training, and Visualization on the Bank Marketing Dataset, focusing on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using Python and common data-science libraries.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing Dataset, available here:
<a href="https://github.com/WebberX45/Prodigy-Infotech-Data-Science-Task-3/blob/main/bank-additional.csv">bank_marketing_dataset.csv</a>.<br>
It contains demographic, social, and campaign-related information about clients contacted during marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. Key features include age, job, marital status, education, credit details, call duration, previous campaign outcomes, and the target variable deposit (yes/no).


## Objective

Analyze the Bank Marketing dataset to:
- Understand customer demographics and campaign behavior
- Explore relationships between key variables
- Preprocess data for model readiness
- Train and evaluate a predictive model for deposit subscription

 
## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


## Key Insights

- Distribution of customers by age, job type, marital status, and education
- Campaign-related patterns such as call duration and contact frequency
- Label encoding applied to all categorical variables
- Decision Tree Classifier used to predict deposit subscription
- Model evaluation using:
   - Accuracy score
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix visualization


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how demographic factors, call duration, and past campaign outcomes influence a client’s likelihood to subscribe to a term deposit. The combination of EDA, preprocessing, and machine learning provides a clear understanding of customer behavior and campaign success patterns.
